# Algorithms
Some basic (and not really) code for algorithms for a quick access
Most of this algorithms covered in Rod Stivenson book which is called, well, "The Algorithms".
Few of his examples were skipped, such as "Serpinsky curve", because of complexity, and just checked somewhere outside just to know
